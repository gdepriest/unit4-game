# Poop Game ðŸ’©

A fun and interactive game for web browsers. This app dynamically updates the HTML pages with the jQuery library.

## Functionality ðŸ’ª
#### Here's how the app works:


* There will be four poops displayed as buttons on the page.
```
for(var i = 0; i< poop.length; i++){
    poop[i].value = getRandom(1, 12);
    var div = $('<div>').addClass('col-md-3 col-sm-6 poo-pic');
    var img = $('<img>').attr('src', poop[i].image).attr('alt', "poop").attr('id', "poop"+(i+1)).attr('data-index', i).addClass("button img-thumbnail")

    $(div).append(img)

    $("#poop-bag").append(div)
}
```

* The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

* When the player clicks on a poop, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 


* Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks a poop.
* When they do click one, update the player's score counter.

* The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
* The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

* The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

* When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the poops will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.

* The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.Here's how the app works:
